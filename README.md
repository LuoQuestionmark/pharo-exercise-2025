# pharo-exercise-2025

This repository contains exercises on Pharo language. These exercises are associated to my Ph.D. candidate.

## Files and Folders

Some files are generated by `Pharo` with its git plugin "iceberg": `./project`, `.properties`. The folder `Exercise1` is exported by the same plugin. To make my changes clear, I have renamed the package from `EarthTutorial` to `Exercise1`.

## Exercise 1

The final version of exercise 1 contains the definition of follow classes:

- `EarthMap`;
- `EarthMapCountry`;
- `EarthCountryBrowser`.

While most of the components are defined directly by the tutorial, I have implemented the necessary code to finish the implementation. By putting the image `world.svg` at the root of working directory, two functionalities are granted:

1. display of world map (by changing each country individually);
2. display of national flags.

```st
"display of world map"
EarthMap new
importCountriesFrom: (FileSystem workingDirectory / 'world.svg' );
openPopulatedCanvas;
yourself
```

```st
"display of national flags"
(EarthCountryBrowser on:
(EarthMap new importCountriesFrom: (FileSystem workingDirectory / 'world.svg' )))
open
```
